# Quasar ðŸš§

Learn how to setup Feathers-Pinia 3 with a Quasar CLI app.

[[toc]]

For Quasar SPA mode, you can adapt the instructions from the [Vite setup guide](./vite.md).

A community contribution/PR will be required for this page to be updated any time soon.

<!-- ## Generate your app

This page specifically covers how to integrate Feathers-Pinia into a Quasar app generated with their CLI. Follow the
instructions on their [Quasar CLI](https://quasar.dev/start/quasar-cli) page to generate a Quasar app. Select these
options:

- **What would you like to build?** `App with Quasar CLI, let's go!`
- **Pick Quasar version:** `Quasar v2 (Vue 3 | latest and greatest)`
- **Pick script type:** Select `TypeScript` if you want to use the typed client.
- **Pick Quasar App CLI variant:** `Quasar App CLI with Vite`. Webpack would likely work, too, but it's untested.
- **Pick a Vue component style:** `Composition API with <script setup>`
- **Check the features needed for your project:** Make sure `State Management (Pinia)` is selected. -->
